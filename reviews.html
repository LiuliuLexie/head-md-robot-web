        "I bought one for myself and bought another for my friend as her birthday present. My friend says hers is like an excitable puppy—jumpy and loud. Mine? Definitely a lazy cat—calm, soft, and unbothered. I didn’t expect each one to feel so unique."

        "On a work trip, I sent a few taps before bed. The next morning, I woke up to a message: our home Coneics had lit up in response. It was a small but powerful reminder of home. For the price, I expected more functionality, but it’s the emotional connection that makes it worth it."
